        In this task, you have to solve short math questions.
        You have {{C.time_maths_mins}} minutes to answer a maximum of {{C.num_rounds_task}} questions.
        In each of the questions you are asked to provide the sum of {{C.num_integers}} integer numbers between {{C.lowest_integer}} and {{C.highest_integer}}.
        The task ends either after {{C.time_maths_mins}} minutes or after you have answered all {{C.num_rounds_task}} questions.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
    <table class="center">
    <tr>
        <td style="font-size:30px; width:70"> {{ C.example_math_n1 }} + {{ C.example_math_n2 }} + {{ C.example_math_n3 }} + {{ C.example_math_n4 }} + {{ C.example_math_n5 }} = </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td style="width:50px">
            <input type="number" min="0" name="input_sequence" id="input_sequence" class="form-control" readonly>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

    <p>
        The correct answer in this example would be 17.

        You can always skip a question by clicking on "Next". In that case you will be directed to the next question.
        Please note that you can never go back to a previous question.
        Instead of clicking "Next" you can also press "enter" to submit your answer and move on to the next question.
    </p>
    <h5> <b> Possible Bonus Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        For each correct answer, you get one point. You do <b> not </b> get any deductions for wrong or missing answers.
        Hence, your total score will be between 0 and {{C.num_rounds_task}}, depending on how many questions you solve correctly.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u>Bonus Payment Example: </u> </p>
    <p>
        If you answer a total of {{C.bonusexample_math}} out of {{C.num_rounds_task}} questions correctly, your overall score for this task will be {{C.bonusexample_math}}.
        The according bonus payment that you would receive if this task was drawn as the "task-that-counts" is {{C.bonusexample_math}} * {{C.bonusrate}} = {{C.bonusexampleresult_math}}.)
