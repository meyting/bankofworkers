    <p>
        In this task you have to solve {{C.num_rounds_task}}  math questions.
        In each of these you have to calculate the sum of {{C.num_integers}} integer numbers between {{C.lowest_integer}} and {{C.highest_integer}}.
        You have {{C.time_maths_mins}} minutes to complete all the {{C.num_rounds_task}}  calculations.
        The task ends either if your time is over or if you have answered all the {{C.num_rounds_task}}  questions. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want, you can skip a question by clicking on "Next". In that case you will be directed to the next question.
        Please note that you cannot go back to the previous question after you have started with the next question by clicking "Next".
        Instead of clicking on "Next" you can also press "enter" to go to the next question and to confirm your input.
        (This might save you some time.)
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
    <table class="center">
    <tr>
        <td style="font-size:30px; width:70"> {{ C.example_math_n1 }} + {{ C.example_math_n2 }} + {{ C.example_math_n3 }} + {{ C.example_math_n4 }} + {{ C.example_math_n5 }} = </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td style="width:50px">
            <input type="number" min="0" name="input_sequence" id="input_sequence" class="form-control" readonly>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
    <p>
        Adding the numbers gives the result 17. Therefore, the correct answer to enter is "17".
    </p>
<br>
    <h5> <b> Score and payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        For each correct answer, you get one point. You do <b> not </b> get any deductions for wrong or missing answers.
        Hence, your total score will be between 0 and {{C.num_rounds_task}}, depending on how many math problems you have solved correctly.
        (As explained above, for each correct answer you receive {{C.bonusrate}}.)
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u> </p>
    <p>
        If you answer a total of {{C.bonusexample_math}} out of {{C.num_rounds_task}} questions correctly, your overall score for this subtask will be {{C.bonusexample_math}}. <br>
        (The bonus payment you get - if this task is drawn as the task that determines you extra money for part I - is {{C.bonusexample_math}} * {{C.bonusrate}} = {{C.bonusexampleresult_math}}.)
