    <p>
        In this task you have to solve {{C.num_rounds_task}}  math questions.
        In each of these you have to calculate the sum of {{C.num_integers}} integer numbers between {{C.lowest_integer}} and {{C.highest_integer}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have {{C.time_maths_mins}} minutes to complete alle the {{C.num_rounds_task}}  calculations.
        The task ends either if your time is over or if you have answered all the {{C.num_rounds_task}}  questions. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind, that the answer will always be a positive integer.
        Thus, there won`t be any negative results or decimals. <b style="color:red"> DO WE NEED THIS?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want, you can skip a question by clicking on "next". In that case you will be directed to the next question. <br>
        Please note that you cannot go back to the previous question after you have started with the next question by clicking "next". <br>
        Instead of clicking on "next" you can also press "enter" to go to the next question and to confirm your input.
        (This might save you some time.)
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
    <img src="{{ static 'mathexample.png' }}" width="250px" height=auto/> <br>
    <p>
        Adding the numbers gives the result 15. Therefore, the correct answer to enter is "15".
    </p>
<br>
    <h5> <b> Score and payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        For each correct answer, you get one point. You do <b> not </b> get any deductions for wrong or missing answers.
        Hence, your total score will be between 0 and {{C.num_rounds_task}}, depending on how many math problems you have solved correctly. <br>
        (As explained before, the bonus payment for this subtask is calculated by multiplying the number of correct answers by {{C.bonusrate}}.)
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u> </p>
    <p>
        If you answer a total of {{C.bonusexample_math}} out of {{C.num_rounds_task}} questions correctly, your overall score for this subtask will be {{C.bonusexample_math}}. <br>
        (The bonus payment you get - if this task is drawn as the task that determines you extra money for part I - is {{C.bonusexample_math}} * {{C.bonusrate}} = {{C.bonusexampleresult_math}}.)
