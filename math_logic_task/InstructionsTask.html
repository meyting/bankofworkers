    <h5> <b> Task: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        The first part of our experiment consists of two subtasks.
        In each of them, you have to answer {{ C.num_rounds_task }} questions within {{ C.time_maths_mins }} minutes.
        That means, you get {{C.time_maths_mins }} minutes to solve {{ C.num_rounds_task }} questions in part I
        and {{ C.time_maths_mins }} minutes to solve {{ C.num_rounds_task }} questions in part II.
        Before each section starts, you will get more information about your task.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5> <b> Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        In both subtasks you can score between 0 and {{C.num_rounds_task }} points depending on how many questions you have answered correctly.
        The bonus payment for each subtask corresponds to your score in that task multiplied by {{ C.bonusrate }}.
        As an example, if you answer {{ C.bonusexample }} questions correctly, you will earn an additional {{ C.bonusexampleresult }} in this part.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of the experiment, one of the two subtasks is randomly selected to determine your
        bonus payment for part I.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next page you will get more information about the first subtask.
