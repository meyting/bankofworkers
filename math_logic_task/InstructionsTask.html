    <h5> <b> Task: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        The first part of our study consists of two tasks.
        In each of them, you have to answer up to {{ C.num_rounds_task }} questions within a certain time limit.
        Before each section starts, you will get more information about your task.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5> <b> Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        At the end of the study, one of the two tasks is randomly selected as the "task-that-counts".
        Your performance in this task determines your bonus payment for part I.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bonus payment depends on the number of correct answers in the task: for each correct answer you receive {{C.bonusrate}}.
        This implies, in order to maximize your payoff, you should try to correctly answer as many questions as possible.

        On the next page you will get more information about the first task.
