    <h5> <b> Task: </b> </h5>
    <p>
    The first part of our experiment consists of two subtasks. In both of them, you have to answer 50 questions within five minutes. <br>
        Before each section starts, you will get more information about your task.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5> <b> Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
    In both subtasks you can score between 0 and 50 points depending on how many questions you have answered correctly. <br>
    The bonus payment for each subtask corresponds to your score in that task divided by X (50?) /multiplied by X? <br>
        At the end of the experiment, one of the two subtasks from part I is randomly selected to determine your
        extra money for part I. <br>
    </p>
    <br>

    On the next page you will get more information about what the first subtask is about. <br> <br>
