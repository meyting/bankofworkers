        Now it is your turn to complete the sequences of numbers, i.e. to actually perform the task mentioned before.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes to complete a maximum of {{C.num_rounds_task}} sequences.
        In order to find the missing number of a sequence, you need to figure out the pattern according to which the number sequence is constructed.
        The task ends either after {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes or after you have completed all {{C.num_rounds_task}} sequences.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
<table class="center">
    <tr>
        <td style="font-size:30px; width:70"> 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ,  </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td style="width:50px">
            <input type="number" min="0" name="input_sequence" id="input_sequence" class="form-control" readonly>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
    <p>
        In this example, the rule according to which the sequence of numbers is constructed is to subtract 1 from the previous number in the sequence.
        Therefore, the correct answer would be "5".
    </p>
    <p>
        You can always skip a sequence by clicking on "Next". In that case you will be directed to the next sequence.
        Please note that you can never go back to a previous question.
        Instead of clicking "Next" you can also press "enter" to submit your answer and move on to the next sequence.
    </p>

    <h5> <b> Possible Bonus Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        For each correct answer, you get one point. You do <b> not </b> get any deductions for wrong or missing answers.
        Hence, your total score will be between 0 and {{C.num_rounds_task}}, depending on how many sequences you complete correctly.
        For each point, you earn {{ C.bonusrate }}.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Bonus Payment Example: </u>  </p>
        If you complete a total of {{C.bonusexample_sequence}} out of {{C.num_rounds_task}} sequences correctly, your overall score for this task will be {{C.bonusexample_sequence}}.
        The according bonus payment that you would receive if this task was drawn as the "task-that-counts" is {{C.bonusexample_sequence}} * {{C.bonusrate}} = {{C.bonusexampleresult_sequence}}.
