<h5> <b> Introduction: </b> </h5>
<p>
    Besides you, other people participate in the same math and logic test you have just worked on.
    On the next two pages, we want to know what you think how well specific subgroups perform in the two tasks.  <br>
    (A subgroup could for example be "people above age 50".) <br>
</p> <br>
<h5> <b> Task: </b> </h5>
<p>
    This part of the experiment is about your assessment of the results of specific subgroups in the math and logic test.
    In total, we want to ask you for your estimate of six different subgroups in both tests. Therefore, this part of the
    experiment consist of 12 subtasks. <br>
    For each subgroup, we randomly draw 100 people and their total scores for each test. <br>
    Your task is, to indicate how well these 100 people of the corresponding subgroup perform on the math or logic test.
    For that, you will have to answer the following three questions in each subtask (i.e., per subgroup and test): <br>
</p>
    <div style="text-indent:20px"> 1. Estimation of the average score of all people of subgroup X </div>
    <div style="text-indent:20px"> 2. Estimation of the average score of the best 10 people of subgroup X (out of the 100 drawn) </div>
    <div style="text-indent:20px"> 3. Estimation of the average score of the worst 10 people of subgroup X (out of the 100 drawn) </div> <br>
    [--> Screenshot?] <br> <br>
    Remember that the possible score in each of the two tests ranges from 0 to 50. <br>
    Please enter only whole numbers as your answer.
    So, if you estimate a decimal number as the value we are asking for, please round it to the nearest integer.
</p> <br>
<h5> <b> Payment: </b> </h5>
<p>
    At the end of the experiment, one of the subtasks (consisting of the three questions explained above)
    will be randomly selected to determine your payment in this second part of the experiment. <br> <br>
    Your extra money is calculated as follows: <br>
    For each of the three questions, you receive an additional payment of 0.50$ if your answer is not more than 3
    points away from the correct value of the drawn sample.
    For this purpose, the actual value in the sample is rounded to a whole number.
