{{ block content }}
<p>
    The previous part is completed by several other people besides you.
    On the next two pages, we want to know what you think how well specific subgroups of people perform in the two tasks.
    Each subgroup consist of {{C.samples}} people.
</p>
<p>
    More specifically, we ask you to predict...
<ul>
    <li> ... the <b>average score of all {{C.samples}} people</b> of a given subgroup,
    <li> ... the <b>average score of the top 10 people</b>, i.e. those with the highest scores, of the respective subgroup,
    <li> ... the <b>average score of the bottom 10 people</b>, i.e. those with the lowest scores, of the respective subgroup.
</ul>
</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
<p> Your predictions of the scores of {{ C.samples }} randomly drawn <b>American</b> participants in the <b>sequence</b> task: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="headlinecolumn">Average All: &nbsp;</td>
      <td class="inputcolumn"><input type="number" class="form-control" readonly></td>
      <td><label for="l_male1_1">points</label></td>
      <td class="fillercolumn">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Average Top 10: &nbsp;</td>
      <td class="inputcolumn"><input type="number" class="form-control" readonly ></td>
      <td><label for="l_male2_1">points</label></td>
      <td class="fillercolumn">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Average Bottom 10: &nbsp;</td>
      <td class="inputcolumn"><input type="number" class="form-control" readonly ></td>
      <td><label for="l_male3_1">points</label></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>
    In this case you are asked to indicate how well American participants performed in the sequence task.
    The first estimate refers to the average of {{C.samples}} randomly drawn American participants.
    The second estimate refers to the average among only the 10 Americans who completed the highest number of sequences correctly.
    The third estimate refers to the average among only the 10 Americans who completed the lowest number of sequences correctly.

<h5> <b> Possible Bonus Payment: </b> </h5>
<p>
    At the end of the study, the assessment of one subgroup will be randomly selected as the "subgroup-that-counts".
    Your assessment of the performance of individuals from this subgroup will determine your bonus payment for part II.
</p>
<p>
    For each of the three predictions (average all, average top 10, average bottom 10) you receive an additional payment of {{C.bonus}} if your answer
    is within {{C.limit}} points around the correct value.
</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Bonus Payment Example: </u>  </p>

            <th style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> True value </th>
            <th style="width=350; text-align:center"> Your payment </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> 1 </td>
            <td style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> 28 </td>
            <td style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> 30 </td>
            <td>  <b> {{C.bonus}} </b> (difference between 28 and 30 is not larger than 3)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> 2</td>
            <td style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> 41 </td>
            <td style="padding:5px; text-align:center"> 36 </td>
            <td>  <b> $0 </b> (difference between 41 and 36 is larger than 3) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding:5px;text-align:center"> 3</td>
            <td style="padding:5px;text-align:center"> 19 </td>
            <td style="padding:5px;text-align:center"> 18 </td>
            <td>  <b> {{C.bonus}} </b> (difference between 19 and 18 is not larger than 3) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="height:40px">
            <td colspan="3" style="text-align:center"> <b>Sum over the three questions:</b>  </td>
            <td style="text-align:center"> <b> {{C.examplebonus}} </b> </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>
        If this subgroup was selected as the "subgroup-that-counts", you would receive an additional bonus payment of <b> {{C.examplebonus}} </b> in part II.
