<i>Please read the following instructions carefully.</i> <br> <br>
    <p>
        This study consists of two main parts and a questionnaire.
    </p>
    <p>
    Besides the fixed participation fee, you will also get the chance to earn two bonus payments in this experiment.
    These additional payments depend on your answers and decisions in the two main parts of the study.
    Your final payment will be the sum of the bonus payments from both parts and the fixed participation fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the beginning of each part, we will explain in detail how the potential bonus payment of the respective parts is determined. <br>
